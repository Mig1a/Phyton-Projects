Write a program that receives an integer from the user and prints Large if that number is greater than or equal to 100, 
prints average if that number is between 20 and 100, and prints Small if that number is less than or equal to 20.
user = int(input('Please enter an integer:'))
if user >= 100:
    print('Large')
elif user > 20 and user < 100:
    print('average')
else:
    print('small')
